                </div> <div class="hidden" id="major-text" contenteditable="true"> <p>My time in
                Halligan Hall and Computer Science has been phenomenal. I have
                learned amazing skills and made even better friendships. Over
                the last few semesters, I have been impressed by the increase
                in the diversity of students in the major and in Halligan in
                general.</p>

                  <p>Recently, I have heard significant dismay and frustration
                  from many students who wish to, but cannot, take more
                  Computer Science courses. My greatest concern is that the
                  richness and diversity of this community is being threatened
                  by the new registration policy. Studies have shown that
                  raising the barrier to entry for Computer Science classes
                  disproportionately discourages enrollment of women as well as
                  men without computational backgrounds. Based on my
                  understanding of the new registration policy, I question how
                  new students will be able to join our community.</p>

                  <p>Furthermore, even though I am a Computer Science major, I
                  have struggled to get the classes I want when I want them due
                  to limited supply and size of courses.</p>

                  <p>To me, being a Computer Scientist is not about being a
                  strange alien who lives in a dark basement staring at
                  011011000111010101110110 till 3 am. It’s about being a
                  builder, a problem-solver, a logical and creative artist who
                  can adapt to tomorrow's opportunities and challenges today.
                  It means so much to have the rest of the world understand, at
                  least a bit, the work that I do and the field that I
                  love.</p>

                  <p>With the new registration policy, this is no longer
                  possible. Such a policy undoes the last decade of progress
                  toward openness and inclusivity in Computer Science as a
                  field. A progression that Tufts has been at the forefront of
                  until last month.</p>

                  <p>Please act with alacrity to address this growing
                  problem.</p>

              <p>All the best,</p> </div> <div class="hidden"
              id="non-major-text" contenteditable="true"> <p>Computer Science is a field I really want
              to explore more. Laptops, phones, and tablets affect my life tens
              to hundreds of times a day. I want to know more about them beyond
              their usage. I want to create with them and understand them. I
              always thought that an education at a liberal arts university
              meant that I could take classes in whatever fields captured my
              curiosity. I do not see how it is possible to maintain the spirit
              of a liberal arts education if Computer Science classes are
              restricted to majors.</p>

                  <p>I am currently unable to register for at least one
                  Computer Science class. I am not a major, but I believe
                  anyone at Tufts should be able to take any number of Computer
                  Science classes without majoring or minoring in CS. Many
                  majors did not declare until after they had taken a few CS
                  classes. What if I haven't tried enough CS to know if its for
                  me?</p>

                  <p>Halligan seems like a really fun and happening place (at
                  least that’s what my CS major friends tell me). I feel I am
                  now cut off from being a member of such a vibrant and diverse
                  community. Taking CS classes would greatly help me as I head
                  out into the professional world. Every Tufts student should
                  have the opportunity to gain these skills and background
                  knowledge that are integral to our information society.</p>
      						
                  <p>I believe CS classes teach much more than just coding.
                  They teach how to be a builder, a problem-solver, a logical
                  and creative thinker who can adapt to tomorrow's
                  opportunities and challenges today. With the new registration
                  policy, I can no longer be a part of this growth and
                  learning. </p>

              <p>Please act with alacrity to address this growing problem.</p>
